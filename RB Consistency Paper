Libraries and Loading in the Play-by-Play
```{r}
setwd("~/Moneyball/Desktop/Moneyball")
library(tidyverse)
library(nflfastR)
library(ggimage)
library(gt)
library(gtExtras)
library(ggforce)

pbp <- load_pbp(2011:2021)
```

Creating the two play-by-play data sets
The reason we need to do two is because we need to group_by RBs to get the rookie season for each player, but we also need to group_by seasons to get the season by 
season data. As a result, I do the two groupings in pbp1 and pbp2 and join them after
```{r}
pbp %>%
  arrange(rusher_player_name) %>%     
  select(play_id, rusher_player_name) %>%
  mutate(rushes = n())

pbp1 <- pbp %>%
  filter(!is.na(rusher_player_name),
        (two_point_attempt == 0)) %>%
  group_by(rusher_player_name) %>%
  ungroup(season) %>%
  summarize(##avg_epa = mean(epa),
            season = season,
            first_year = first(season)) %>%
  mutate(year = season - first_year + 1) %>%
  distinct() ## this one has years, first years, but only career numbers
pbp2 <- pbp %>%  
  filter(!is.na(rusher_player_name),
         (two_point_attempt == 0)) %>%
  group_by(rusher_player_name,season) %>%
  summarize(avg_epa = mean(epa),
            epa = sum(epa),
            avg_wpa = mean(wpa),
            season = season,
            rushes = n(),
            rushyards = sum(rushing_yards),
            recyards = sum(receiving_yards),
            YPC = rushyards/rushes) %>%
            filter(rushyards >= 100) %>%
  distinct()
```
Note: during this, I realized there were NAs for many players, so I took one of the players who had NAs which was Arian Foster and investigated closer. When I was going through his data, I saw that his 2PT Conversion successes were returning as NA rushing yards because the computer wasn't sure if a 2PT conversion should be 2 rushing yards or none. AS you can see in lines 35 and 45, I filtered out 2PT conversions. Below is the code for Foster
```{r}
adrianfoster <- pbp %>%
  filter(rusher_player_name == 'A.Foster') %>%
  select(rusher_player_name, 
         rushing_yards, 
         play_type, 
         play_id, 
         yards_gained, 
         season)

adrianfoster[is.na(adrianfoster$rushing_yards),] 

fosterplay4185 <- pbp %>%
  filter(rusher_player_name == 'A.Foster',
         play_id == '4185',
         season == '2013') %>%
  select(desc)
```

Testing the groupings and join with the first runningback, Ameer Abdullah
```{r}
abdullah <- inner_join(pbp1, pbp2, by = 'rusher_player_name') %>%
  select(rusher_player_name, first_year, season.y, avg_epa, epa,avg_wpa, rushes, rushyards) %>%
  distinct()
```

Now repeat the process for all RBs
```{r}
careerwithyears <- inner_join(pbp1, pbp2, by = 'rusher_player_name') %>%
  select(rusher_player_name, first_year, season.y, avg_epa, epa, avg_wpa, rushes, rushyards, YPC) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  rename(season = season.y) %>%
  mutate(years_in_league = season - first_year + 1)
```

Time to Make Graphs!

Season x Rushing Yards
```{r}

  theme_bw()+

       subtitle = "Blue Line Represents Average Rushing Yards Across All RBs
